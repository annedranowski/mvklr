\title{From moment polytope to multidegree and back again: Examples}

\begin{goal}
    % Recover MV polytope from hilbert series of KLR module.
    We can get a MV polytope from a hilbert series (in fact from much less the multidegree). Can we get a hilbert series from a MV polytope? If we decorate the edges sufficiently? Whatever that means.
\end{goal}
% 
This is hard.

% \begin{enumerate}
    % \item 
    The recursive nature of a moment polytope: it is at once a path in a crystal and an element in a crystal---the endpoint of the path. That's just the recursive nature of a tree, of which a crystal is an instance: a node is a branch (path) is a node.
